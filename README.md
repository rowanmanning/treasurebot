# Treasure Hunt Slack Messages

This is a bot used to post messages as other people.

You'll need to create an `.env` file with the Treasure Bot Slack token. You can get this from Rowan. It should end up looking something like this:

```
SLACK_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXX
```

Add new message scripts to the `script` folder. To run a script, use:

```
node ./script/script-name.js
```
